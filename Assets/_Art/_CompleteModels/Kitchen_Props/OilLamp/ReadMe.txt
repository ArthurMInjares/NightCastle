Model is made of two parts: The base and the glass.

-Both parts have the exact same pivot, so if their transform positions 
 are exactly the same they should align perfectly.

-Both parts must be combined via a group/empty object in unity.

-Both parts use the exact same texture maps but should use seperate materials in unity.

-The material for the base part should have rendering mode set to opaque.

-The material for the glass part should have rendering mode set to transparent.

-Add a light and fire effect(or dont) 

-Turn into prefab
